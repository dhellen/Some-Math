=========

Among other hobbies, I like sitting at my computer and doing stuff with Python.

I wrote verything in this repo, but because it's all pretty small and relatively generic I choose to license it under the CC0 License, which means it's in the public domain in locations in which the public domain exists legally, and that it is the equivalent of public domain in locations where there is no such thing as the public domain.
