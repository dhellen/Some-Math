Some-Math
=========

Among other hobbies, I like sitting at my computer and doing stuff with Python.

I wrote everything in this repo, but because it's all pretty small and relatively generic (some of it is downright ubiquitous) I choose to license it under the CC0 License, which means it's in the public domain in locations in which the public domain exists legally, and that it is the equivalent of public domain in locations where there is no such thing as the public domain.

A factorial function appears in both combinatorics.py and hacktorial.py. Hacktorial.py was basically me playing around with functional programming, and I wrote it after combinatorics.py, so the code is different, but they will produce the exact same thing.
